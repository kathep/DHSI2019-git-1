## Part 1. Create a GitHub Account
1) Navigate to https://github.com/  
2) Create an account.  
3) If it doesn't automatically do so, login.  

## Part 2. Create a Repository (ie. Cloud-Based Project)
1) Navigate to your account home (click the cat icon in the top left).
2) Create a new repository by clicking the green "New" box.
3) Name your repository (ex. "DHSI2019-git")
4) Give it a short description ("DHSI 2019 Git Tutorial")
5) Decide on your privacy settings (public vs. private)
6) Select “Initialize this repository with a README”.
    - The README will be a text file in Markdown format and will be the landing page for your project.
7) Leave the other settings as the default.

## Part 3. Web-Browser Repository Walkthrough
1) The tabs at the top (Code, Issues, Pull requests...) are for your development use. Code is where all your project files are stored.
2) "Watch" and "Star" are the social media platform options of GitHub (Follow and Like)
3) The next section of tabs (Commits, 1 branch, 0 releases, environment, 1 contributor) relate to the activity and history of your repository.  
**Commits** - Like the "Save As" function of Git. This will shows all the saved changes to each file.  
**Branches** - Project development isn't always linear. You can maintain forks or branches of a project if you feel an aspect has changed significantly.  
**Releases** - If your project has reached a major milestone (yay you got published!!) this is where you provide highly-visible major releases for your audience.  
4) Dropdown menu "Branch: master", this is where you can change between the different branches of your project.
5) Button "New Pull Request", pull requests are how a project gets merged between different development branches. This can occur just for one user (a researcher testing out different development ideas) or between collaborators.
6) Buttons "Create new file/Upload file/Find File" simplistic file management in the web browser. There are better options we will demonstrate later, but it works all the same.
7) Button "Clone or download": this button is to download an entire repository to your computer. You can use the "Download Zip" option if you're interested in using the repository content without developing or contributing. "Cloning" is what we will be doing later in this tutorial to download files but keep them in a format that still allows for git tracking and version control.   

**Part 4. Install the GitHub Desktop Client**
1) Download GithubDesktopSetup from https://desktop.github.com/
2) Run the Installer.
3) Sign in to GiHhub.com through installer.
4) Configure Git to your preferred name and email.
5) Decide on sending usage stats
6) Select demo repository (ktmeaton/DHSI2019-git) and select “Clone”
7) Choose the “Local path” where you want your project files to be installed to.
